# HW4 FFmpeg

# Overview
Use FFmpeg to re-encode a video file (MOV, or MP4) to two bitrates:
- 720p at 2Mbps and 30fps
- 480p at 1Mbps and 30fps

Display each video frame for 3 seconds

# Assignment Goal
- use a twitter feed, construct a daily video summarizing a twitter handle's day.
  - convert text into an image in a frame.
  do a sequence of all texts and images in chronological order
  display each video frame for 3 seconds.
- build a scheduling system so that whenever someone calls the API - tells user they're in the que...etc.


# HOW TO START

- build whole system with mock API then integrate the whole twitter thing after


# Tasks

Estimate the processing power need to execute such operations on your computer
Estimate the maximum number of such operations that can run on your system
## Task 2:
Design a module that can queue and process videos and notify the caller when the videos are ready
Implement the module
Include tracking interface to show how many processes are going on and success of each
